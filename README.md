Data Types

ðŸŽ¯ Aim To learn about various data types in programming, particularly in C++.

ðŸ“š Theory: In C++, data types define the type of data a variable can hold. They are essential for declaring variables, function return types, and parameters. Data types in C++ are broadly classified into built-in, derived, and user-defined types. Built-in types include int, float, char, double, and bool, which are used to store numerical, character, and boolean values. Derived types like arrays, pointers, and references are formed from built-in types. User-defined types such as struct, class, union, and enum help in building complex data structures. The void type represents functions that do not return any value. Modifiers such as signed, unsigned, short, and long enhance the flexibility and range of data types. Understanding these types is fundamental in writing efficient and error-free C++ programs.

âœ… Conclusion: By studying various data types in C++, we gained a clear understanding of how data is categorized, stored, and processed in memory. This foundational knowledge enables programmers to select appropriate data types for different applications, ensuring optimized memory usage and program correctness.
